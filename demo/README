hey !
good morning :)

few things that u should know

1. i used h2 as my db
2. in "conf" class u can see using the services regardless to the controller
3. i had a problem with the session, didnt have time to look into this that is why i used eager loading instead of lazy
4. i checked the controller using curl
5. the total amount of time was around 4-5 hours.

hope i will like it :)
